Using Module pattern and Factory function to implement Tic tac toe game This is very challenging using module pattern for the first time was looking hard and googling to understand to the logic behind it.
I did make it work by self but I looked for multiple options and I did recreate it by what I understand.
Not shame to say this, thank's for anyone who try to explain this for others!

The code miss comments and kinda messy mayble later I'll back and fix it!
